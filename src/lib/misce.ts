  //   title: "Jane Eyre",
  //   author: "Charlotte Bronte",
  //   body: "A lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he wishes to catch a glimpse of her fair face without waking her. He steals softly over the grass, careful to make no sound; he pauses-fancying she has stirred : he withdraws; not for worlds would he be seen. All is still: he again advances: he bends above her; a light veil rests on her features: he lifts it, bends lower; now his eyes anticipate the vision of beauty-warm, and blooming, and lovely, in rest. How hurried was their first glance! But how they fix! How he starts! How he suddenly and vehemently clasps in both arms the form he dared not, a moment since, touch with his finger! How he calls aloud a name, and drops his burden, and gazes on it wildly! He thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because he no longer fears to waken by any sound he can utter-by any movement he can make. He thought his love slept sweetly: he finds she is stonedead.",

  //   author: "Jon Krakauer",

  //   author: "Charles Dickens",
  //   body: `We went on in this way for a long time, and it seemed likely that we should continue to go on in this way for a long time, when one day Miss Havisham stopped short as she and I were walking, she leaning on my shoulder; and said with some displeasure,- "You are growing tall, Pip!" I thought it best to hint, through the medium of a meditative look, that this might be occasioned by circumstances over which I had no control.`,

  //   title: "Great Expectations",
  //   author: "Charles Dickens",
  //   body: `"And then, dear boy, it was a recompense to me, look'ee here, to know in secret that I was making a gentleman. The blood horses of them colonists might fling up the dust over me as I was walking; what do I say? I says to myself, 'I'm making a better gentleman nor ever you'll be! ... If I ain't a gentleman, nor ain't got no learning, I'm the owner of such. All on you owns stock and land; which on you owns a brought-up London gentleman?'"`,

  //   body: `"Many people may be to blame for your unhappiness, but nobody is ever responsible for your unhappiness but you. This is because you always get to choose how you see things, how you react to things, how you value things. You always get to choose the metric by which to measure your experiences."`,
